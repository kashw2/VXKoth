# VXLabs - VXKoth Stat Tracking Web Portal

Wollah, this is the repository of what was formally VXLabs's King of the Hill Stat Tracking Website.

## Background

VXKoth was a project that myself and a few others undertook after our resignation from one of the major and most renowned Arma 3 communities out at the time. At the time our goal was to create something that would be bigger and better than the competition. In some areas we succeeded, in some, we didn't. This is what I gave to the team. This is what at the end of everything, I had put forth. Bear in mind that I never got to complete this due to a few unforeseeable circumstances however I am proud of the way this turned out. Throughout all the bugs, it was good to feel like I was working on something with a group of solid and great people.

So why? Why have I made this public?

Well, at current, the VXLabs team quite simply has no use for this anymore. It's honestly just sitting around, not doing anything. So I thought that it'd be a good chance to put it to use and hopefully, fix up a few things that I've done incorrectly and use it as a portfolio piece so to speak and as a piece in my development hall of fame.

I've removed all pieces of data that I could remember that could mean anything to the VXLabs team, maybe you'll find one of my API keys somewhere in here that I forgot about before I published this repo. If so, it's whatever.

Majority of the bugs with this are all cosmetic and have something to do with animation or just styling. I'm hoping that in my spare time I'll be able to fix them and turn this into something that I could present for future employment.
